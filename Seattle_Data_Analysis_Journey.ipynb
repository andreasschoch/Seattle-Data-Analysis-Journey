    "\n",
    "**Project Motivation:** I am still planning a trip to visit Seattle, maybe in 2023. Therefore I am going to start a seattle data analysis journey of available airbnb data to find an appropriate location. An appropriate location for me should be cheap and should meet the promising expectations. Therefore, in a first step I try to find the top 5 cheapest area's in seattle for a stay and in a second step I try to find a specific location with the best price-rating-ratio within the top 5 cheapest area's. The price-rating-ratio reflects the requirement to a location to meet the promising expectations. Last but not least I am interesting in what the top 5 influencing factors of price-rating-ratio are?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset:** The used dataset can be found on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle?select=reviews.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodology:** I've used the CISP-DM data science process model to execute the data analytics journey which consists of the following six steps:\n",

    "1. What are the top 5 cheapest area's in general for a stay in seattle?\n",
    "2. What are the top 5 location's with the best \"price-rating-ratio\" within the 5 cheapest area's?\n",

    "In the second chapter **data understanding** I load the necessary libraries and the airbnb dataset. After this, I run some data quality checks to get know the features and to check the overall quality of features, especially by calculating missing values per feature. In addition to that I create plots to get some insights into the data. "

The house is located in a nice and quiet neighborhood. Transportation to downtown Seattle is easily available. The drive frome the airport was not long. The room was very clean and tidy and the  bed very comfortable. We had our separate bathroom with this Family room, which was nice, too. We shared a kitchen, dining room and living room with the other guests, who stayed at the house. All very clean and tidy. The ingredients for breakfast were amazing. We were able to help ourselves in the kitchen, preparing pancakes, which my children loved. We had nice talks with Alessandro and the other guests staying at the house, who gave us good advice on visiting and sightseeing Seattle. I can highly recommend this place and would always come back, if going to Seattle for a second time. \",\n",

The room is indeed very small, looks a bit bigger in the picture due to the lens, and was very dirty. The bed was comfortable and sheets clean, but there was dirt, hair etc. all over the floor - it looked like the floor hadn't been cleaned in weeks. The same was the case for the bathroom. Bathroom surfaces were fine, but floor and mat were really disgusting. I would advise anyone turned off by dirty surfaces to avoid this host. \",\n",

The space is located in a fun and safe neighborhood with transit options just a short walk away.  Mary welcomed me to her home with her always delightful and cheerful personality and really made me feel like I was returning to my own place every night.  She has two large dogs who are very awesome to spend time with, always up to things that amuses me greatly.  If one word sums up this experience, it would be wonderful.  I had an awesome stay and time at this home.  As long as the sun is out, there is plenty of natural lighting sources that helps to maintain the positive vibe that Mary creates.  Additionally, be prepared to have a selection of homemade treats that Mary prepares for her guests.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThanks Mary!!',\n",

       " \"Mary was a most welcoming host. She showed me the rules of the house, I met her two senior dogs - both sweet - and saw the house and my room and bathroom. The room is very clean, and I was pleased to have my own bathroom right next door. She provided toiletries and towels, and even included snacks in my room. Speaking of snacks - Mary likes to bake and she also likes to share her baking. So I partook of sweet bread, apple pie, oatmeal cookies (absolutely fabulous by the way - yum!) and she even made dog cookies the last day and sent me away with a bag for my own dog back home. (Note to Mary: Sadie LOVED those cookies!) Mary was very caring in checking with me about heat in the room, making sure the dogs were not bothering me in any way and giving me directions to places I needed to go. She has a table full of information on Seattle - things to do and see, restaurants, etc. Very helpful if you are on holiday.\\r\\nI was in SEattle to do a 3-day workshop so I came home pretty tired every night. The bed was comfortable and warm and the area is very quiet.\\r\\nThe dogs are both seniors and don't move around much. They were very friendly and loved to be petted. This was nice for me because I was missing my own dog who stayed home this trip.\\r\\nMary was open to my using her kitchen and watching her tv. I even played around a bit with her player piano!\\r\\nMary is a lovely host. And you will never go hungry - a bonus!\",\n",

At one point I had to take a shower and be out the door by 3:30 AM. We had the chance to talk a couple of times during my stay, she was not only a great hostess, but a good friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was always trying to feed me, which was much appreciated because I would often times not bother. She would have bags of snacks ready for me each morning with fun pictures and my name on them.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver all it was a great first air B&B experience. Highly suggested.',\n",

       " \"While working in downtown Seattle for a month, I had the pleasure of staying in the Bunny Room. I loved how much light the house gets. House of the Light is the perfect name. Mary is such a gracious host and her home is a REAL Bed and Breakfast. Mary is an avid traveller so she knows what it's like to be a guest and she makes sure you feel at home.  \\r\\nSince I am kinda particular with my diet, she was so sweet to ask me what I would like for breakfast and voila! Ask Mary and you shall receive. Every morning coffee would be ready, with my soy creamer, stevia, fruits galore (the fridge was PACKED) and she even found some extra vegan goodies for me to try. She even cut a pineapple for the first time for me (if you have ever done it, it's not easy) and I thought that was so thoughful. She loves to bake so there are always plenty of delicious baked goods. If you have a favorite baked good, I would highly recommend you tell her because it will be made for you the next day. \\r\\nI biked to and from downtown and on some days when it was raining, she would offer me a ride. Mary was always checking in to make sure everything was ok and if she could do anything more to make my stay more enjoyable. \\r\\n I loved having full use of the kitchen. I really felt at home making my meals, and she freely shared everything. \\r\\nHer home is close to Columbia City and there are so many cute restaurants and bars there that you don’t get downtown. I enjoyed going to the Columbia Theater one night by myself and met some very cool friendly people.  I went back the next night for Karaoke night and it was a blast. Very friendly neighborhood. Seward Park and Lake Washington are close by for a wonderful bike ride or walk.\\r\\nThe House of Light is the perfect place when you are away yet but you still want the feeling of a home, use of a full kitchen, access to a pretty backyard patio to sit and have coffee, enjoy fresh baked goods and enjoy the Seattle weather. Thanks Mary!\",\n",
       " 'I had a great time staying with Mary. I recently moved to Seattle and needed a place to stay while I looked for somewhere to live permanently. I had never been to Seattle before this trip so having a local help guide me was very helpful.

       " \"I had just gotten a job in Seattle when I stayed at Mary's house and I can't imagine a warmer welcome to the city. Mary is a true fan of Seattle and was happy to provide all kinds of information (and even a lift in her car). The Ranier Valley neighborhood is a fascinating mix of cultures (Ethiopian restaurants and Buddhist monasteries, to name a few) and is easily accessible to downtown, and from there to anywhere. Plus, if you like fresh-baked cookies or breads, or homemade soups, you'd love Mary's house for that reason alone. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe house is high energy—both Mary and her dog, Gracie :-) —so come prepared for lots of coffee and friendly conversation. But if you're not into those things, you'd probably still enjoy a visit. \",\n",

Got a tour by the young lady running the home, and she was always available for questions and very pleasant. Home is looked after well and things were as the ad suggested. Dario was quick to get back with me whenever I needed to extend my stay or make alterations with it. To me, having the one bathroom was never an issue because you get to know the schedule of others in the home by simply observing the comings and goings, and planning accordingly. \",\n",

I did a short weekend trip in Seattle and needed a central place to stay. I didn't want to bother with a hotel since my trip was short and I would honestly just need a place to sleep and shower. For the price and location it was awesome! It's a short 20 min uber ride to downtown. The house was clean and neat.
